  Let $x$ and $y$ agree stand for $x = y$.

  Let a member of $X$ stand for an element of $X$.
  Let $x$ belongs to $X$ stand for $x \in X$.
  Let $X$ contains $x$ stand for $x \in X$.
  Let $x$ is contained in $X$ stand for $x \in X$.
  Let $x$ lies in $X$ stand for $x$ is an element of $X$.

  \begin{definition}
    An element is a setsized object.

  \begin{axiom}
    Every element is an element of some set.
    % We need this axiom to ensure that the proof tasks for low-level class
