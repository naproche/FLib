  \section{Closedness conditions}

  \subsection{Sub- and supersets}

  \begin{forthel}
    Let $X, Y, Z$ denote a system of sets.

    \begin{definition}
      $X$ is closed under subsets within $Y$ iff every subset $S$ of any element of $X$ such that $S \in Y$ belongs to $X$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
      $X$ is closed under subsets iff every subset of any element of $X$ belongs to $X$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
      $X$ is closed under supersets within $Y$ iff every superset $S$ of any element of $X$ such that $S \in Y$ belongs to $X$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
      $X$ is closed under supersets iff every superset of any element of $X$ belongs to $X$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{proposition}
      There is no system of sets that is closed under supersets.
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
      Assume the contrary.
      Take a system of sets $X$ that is closed under supersets.
      % ...
    \end{proof}
  \end{forthel}


  \subsection{Finite intersections and unions}

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{definition}
      $X$ is closed under finite intersections iff the intersection over every finite subset of $X$ is an element of $X$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{proposition}
      $X$ is closed under finite intersections iff $x \cap y \in X$ for all $x,y \in X$.
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
      % ...
    \end{proof}

    \begin{definition}
      $X$ is closed under finite unions iff the union over every finite subset of $X$ is an element of $X$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{proposition}
      $X$ is closed under finite unions iff $x \cup y \in X$ for all $x,y \in X$.
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
      % ...
    \end{proof}
  \end{forthel}


  \subsection{Countable intersections and unions}

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{definition}
      $X$ is closed under countable intersections iff the intersection over every countable subset of $X$ is an element of $X$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
      $X$ is closed under countable unions iff the union over every countable subset of $X$ is an element of $X$.
    \end{definition}
  \end{forthel}


  \subsection{Arbitrary intersections and unions}

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{definition}
      $X$ is closed under intersections iff the intersection over every subset of $X$ is an element of $X$.
    \end{definition}

    Let $X$ is closed under arbitrary intersections stand for $X$ is closed under intersections.

    \begin{definition}
      $X$ is closed under unions iff the union over every subset of $X$ is an element of $X$.
    \end{definition}

    Let $X$ is closed under arbitrary unions stand for $X$ is closed under unions.
  \end{forthel}


  \subsection{Complements}

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{definition}
      $X$ is closed under complementation in $z$ iff $z \setminus x \in X$ for all $x \in X$.
    \end{definition}
  \end{forthel}
