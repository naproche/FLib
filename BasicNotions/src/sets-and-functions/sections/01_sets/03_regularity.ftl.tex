  \section{The axiom of regularity}

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{axiom}[Regularity]
      Every nonempty set $x$ that contains some set contains some set $y$ such that $x$ and $y$ are disjoint.
    \end{axiom}

    \begin{proposition}[SF 01 03 877283]
      No set $x$ is an element of $x$.
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
      Assume the contrary.
      Take a set $x$ such that $x \in x$.
      We can take an element $y$ of $\set{x}$ such that $\set{x}$ and $y$ are disjoint (by regularity).
      Indeed $\set{x}$ contains some set.
      Then $y = x$.
      Hence $\set{x}$ and $x$ are disjoint.
      Contradiction.
      Indeed $x \in \set{x}$ and $x \in x$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{corollary}[SF 01 03 722484]
      There is no set that contains every set.
    \end{corollary}
    \begin{proof}
      Assume the contrary.
      Take a set $V$ that contains every set.
      Then $V$ is an element of $V$.
      Contradiction.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{proposition}[SF 01 03 512352]
      There exist no sets $x,y$ such that $x \in y$ and $y \in x$.
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
      Assume the contrary.
      Take sets $x,y$ such that $x \in y$ and $y \in x$.
      Consider an element $z$ of $\set{x,y}$ such that $\set{x,y}$ and $z$ are disjoint (by regularity).
      Indeed $\set{x,y}$ contains some set.
      We have $z = x$ or $z = y$.

      Case $z = x$.
        Then $x$ and $\set{x,y}$ are disjoint.
        Hence $y \notin x$.
        Contradiction.
      End.

      Case $z = y$.
        Then $y$ and $\set{x,y}$ are disjoint.
        Hence $x \notin y$.
        Contradiction.
      End.
    \end{proof}
