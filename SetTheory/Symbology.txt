Functions:
Dom(f)      - the domain of a function f (already integrated; per axiom this is a set (class))
ran(f)      - the range of f
f^[M]       - the image of M under a zffunction f
f /caret M  - the image of M under a function f, basically the same as f^[M], but it is important that we
                only write down the image of zffunctions, otherwise we create sets whose object might be proper classes

f : A /leftrightarrow B - f is a bijective zffunction from A to B
f^{-1}      - the inverse of f for injective zffunctions f (otherwise in inverse would not be a function)
f /upharpoonright M     - the restricton of f to M for M /subset Dom(f)
f ^ n       - for integers n the n--fold composition of f with itself, for proper functions f (only defined                     to proof some lemmas, not used later-on)
^{A}B       - the class of zffunctions from A to B
g /comp f   - the pointwise composition of functions
