# Notes concerning the different files:


Every section ends with "Lemma: Contradiction". This obviously should be wrong and hence the eprover should fail here.
This is a check if we lead to a contradiction with our axioms. In this case the proven results may be wrong
because with a contradiction in our axioms anything follows.
If the prover checked everything but the last lemma we are asured that everything is fine.

Everything was checked with Isabelle_Naproche-20190611 and should work fine.
Sometimes some errors occur, then one has to add additional help so the eprover can continue.
Mostly just a rephrasing is needed so the proof checker has another try. But everything was successfully checked several times,
so everything should be logically true.


The different sections continue to formalize set theory.
One could therefore put most of them in a sigle very long ForTheL-file,
but then Naproche might be overwhelmed with the length and it takes too long to prove everything.
Therefore I separated the content in different files and in the top of each file I state the important result 
from previous sections as axioms, so I do not need to reproof the results we already know.
This way the checking time is bounded and works just fine.






1-ZF-Sets

Here we introduce a new notion "zfsets" which are the set-theoretical sets. So we can distinguish the real sets
(zfsets) with (proper) classes (sets).
We stated the ZF-axioms for zfsets, so we can proof which sets are zfsets and which sets are proper classes.

/VV is now the set of all zfsets, using foundation we see that /VV is a proper class.

An axiom is that every object of a set is a zfset (since a proper class cannot be an element of a class).
Therefore we have to pay attention which set-constructions we define.
For example we must not define pairs {a,b} where a or b might be a proper class which would lead to an axiomatic contradiction.

We did not introduce functions yet, so we do not have replacement.

Later on we introduce ordinals, the class /Ord of all ordinals, some basic lemmata about ordinals and /NN, the set of natural numbers.

Main Results:

- /VV is a proper class
- /Ord is a proper class
- x zfset, x /subset /Ord => /bigcup x /in /Ord
- ordinals are totally ordered
- /NN is a zfset
- /NN /in /Lim







2-Formalizing Pairs and Functions

Here we introduce ordered pairs the set-theoretic way as (a,b) = {{a},{a,b}} and show that this has the properties we want for an ordered pair.
Relations are defined as a set of ordered paird and functions are introduced as relations with additional properties.
We defined Id as the set of pairs (x,x) and showed that some basic properties about Id hold.

In this section we do not distinguish between sets and zfsets. But we will see that even without the axiom of foundation
we will come to a contradiction.

Main Results:

- For any set A there is an injective map F : A /rightarrow /PP A.
- For any set A there is no injective map G : /PP A /rightarrow A.

The second lemma leads to a contradiction: Since /VV is considered as a set itself we now have /VV = /PP /VV.
So Id is in fact an injective map from /PP /VV to /VV.
So here we see that even without foundation, only with the introduction of the power set we lead to a contradiction.
So we need to introduce zfset even for basic set theory.






3-New implementation of pairs

This is the same as section 2, but now we use the integrated ordered pairs of Naproche.
We need an axiom such that ordered pairs work as before.
We also use the integrated functions. So now a function is not a set of ordered paird, but it has a domain and
for any object in the domain we have an attached value.
An axiom states that to functions are the same iff the domain is the same and all values are the same.
Another axiom states that the domain of a function is a set.

The main results are the same as in section 2 and we get the same contradiction in the end.






4-Cardinals Part 1.

Starting here we always distinguish between sets and classes since we saw how fast we lead towards a contradiction.
And we always use the integrated ordered pairs and functions, since it will safe much computing space.
Otherwise Naproche gets confused very quickly. We only need basic properties of functions: a domain and values
for every element of the domain. So there is no need to use the existence of a certain ordered pair in the function
to know if an element is in the domain and which value the function takes on this object.

Since we now have functions we can state the axiom of replacement.
But again we have to be careful - the integrated functions are defined very freely, so not all functions we can write down
are set theoretic functions. The main problem is that the values might be proper classes, so we come to a contradiction
if we define the image/range of all functions. And replacement obviously is also wrong.
So we introduce the notion of zffunctions which are functions such that every value is in /VV.
Just an axiom stating that every value of every function is a zfset won't work, since functions are already implemented,
so we can easyly proof a contradiction by just wrting down a function such that this axiom does not hold.

So we continue with our results of section 1. We introduce cardinals and proof some more or less basic facts of cardinals and cardinalities which are sometimes very tedious to proof.

Main results:

- Complete Induction on /NN (although this lemma has too many assumptions, so it is easier to just reproof this when needed instead of linking to this lemma, Naproche quickly forgets about this lemma or cannot apply it since it is too long)
- We introduce f^n for certain functions and show some basic facts
- being equipotent is an equivalence relation
- Card(kappa) = kappa for cardinals kappa
- x /subset y => Card(x) /subset Card(y) (very tedious to formally proof this)
- (x <= y /\ y <= x) <=> (Card(x) = Card(y))
- forall n /in /NN Card(n) = n
- Card(/NN) = /NN
- x < /PP x
- /Card is a proper class







5-Von Neumann Hierarchy

Here we define the function V of the Von Neumann Hierarchy and the rank function and proof the main properties.

Main results:

- V is a zffunction (forall alpha V[alpha] /in /VV)
- Ordinal induction (as for complete induction this is a nice lemma, but Naproche cannot apply it since too many assumptions are needed, so we always just copy the proof)
- beta /in alpha => (V[beta] /in V[alpha] /\ V[beta] /subset V[alpha] /\ Trans(V[alpha]))
- V[alpha] /cap /Ord = alpha
- /VV = /bigcup ran(V)
- rk[x] = /bigcup rk+^[x]








6-Arithmetic

Here we introduce ordinal addition/multiplication/potentiation and show some basic/intuitive facts.
Then we go on with finite sets and show some closedness properties.
Then we define the Plus-function for cardinals and the Alefs.

Main results:

- facts about addition/multiplication/potentiation
- facts about finite sets
- all infinite cardinals are limit ordinals
- forall alpha Alef[alpha] /in /Card
- alpha /in beta => Alef[alpha] /in Alef[beta]
- for all infinite cardinals kappa there is alpha with kappa = Alef[alpha]
- exists kappa (kappa = Alef[kappa])







7-Mostowski Collapse

Here we reintoduce relations (as sets of ordered pairs) and define different kinds of relations.
We define eps as the relation "/in" of zfsets and show that it is strongly wellfounded and that it is a wellorder on /Ord.
Then we define the transitive collapse for any strongly wellordered relation and define the thansitive closure
for zfsets (for eps as well as for any SWR).

Main results:

- TCol is a zffunction
- The range of TCol is transitive
- for extensional R TCol is injective (hence bijective onto its image)
- TCol is a homomorphism between the relations R and eps
- the range is an ordinal iff the domain of the relation is a zfset; otherwise it is /Ord
- x /subset alpha => otp(x) /subset alpha






8-Transitive Closure

This section is similiar to the previous one, but that one was too long and for every new proof Isabelle jumped up
some hundred lines so every small proof took a long time. So I stated the important results from that section as axioms
and continued here.

Main results:

- for every SWR, every zfset x the transitive closure is in /VV
- definition and existance of the transitive closure wrt eps






9-Cardinals Part 2

This section alignes with section 4 and 6. We need some the Mostowsi Collapse, but only the results, not the construction.
Here we start with the Goedel Ordering and show that it is a strong wellorder so we can apply TCol.

Main results:

- forall x,y /in /VV (x /times y /in /VV)
- goedel is a strong wellorder
- forall x /in /VV x /tilde (x /times x)





10-Cardinal Arithmetic

Here we introduce cardinal arithmetic. To distinguish this from ordinal arithmetic we write +3, *3, ^3 instead of +,*,^.
We added an axiom that a zffunction with domain in /VV is a zfset, which can be proven if we used the set theoretic implementation of functions,
where functions are just certain classes of ordered pairs. Since we used the implemented functions, this needs to be an axiom.
Then we proved that for given zfsets A,B the class of zffunctions from A to B is a zfsets.
For this we did not need any more axioms, this follows directly from replacement for a nice function.
Then we proved some important calculation rules for cardinal arithmetic and concluded the first results about the size of the power set, which is one of the main questions of set theory.

Main results:

- forall zfsets A,B ^{A}B is a zfset.
- some calculation rules, the most interesting beeing a^(b+c) = a^b * a^c and (a^b)^c = a^(b*c)
- forall infinite kappa (kappa = kappa * kappa).
- forall lambda between 2 and 2^kappa (2^kappa = lambda^kappa).








11-Cofinality

Here again we need the function otp which associates to every subset of /Ord its order-type.
However we now do it in a simpler way by using axioms which gives us the desired properties of otp.
These properties were proven before but we safe much calculation time by not defining the construction of otp.
We then define cofinality (as the minimal order-type of a cofinal subset), show that it is the same as the minimal cardinality
of a cofinal subset and proof some facts about the cofinality of some cardinals.

Main results:

- the minimal cardinal of a cofinal subset coincides with the minimal otder-type
- cof(lambda) is regular
- cof(Alef[lambda]) = cof(lambda)
- every infinite successor cardinal is regular
