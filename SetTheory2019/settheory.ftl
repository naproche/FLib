# 2 The Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms
# =============================

# The diculties around Russell's paradox and also around the axiom of choice
# lead Zermelo to the formulation of axioms for set theory in the spirit of the
# axiomatics of David Hilbert of whom Zermelo was an assistant at the time.
# Zermelo's main idea was to restrict Frege's Axiom V to formulas which
# correspond to mathematically important formations of collections, but to avoid
# arbitrary formulas which can lead to paradoxes like the one exhibited by
# Russell. The original axiom system of Zermelo was extended and detailed by
# Abraham Fraenkel (1922), Dmitry Mirimanoff (1917/20), and Thoralf Skolem.
# We shall discuss the axioms one by one and simultaneously introduce the
# logical language and useful conventions.


# 2.1 Set Existence
# -----------------

# [...] The [set existence] axiom expresses the existence of a set which has no
# elements, i.e., the existence of the empty set.


## >>>>>>>

  Definition. The empty set is the set that has no elements.
  Let \emptyset stand for the empty set.
  Let x is nonempty stand for x is not the empty set.
  Let x is empty stand for x is the empty set.

# <<<<<<<


# 2.2 Extensionality
# ------------------

# The axiom of extensionality [...] expresses that a set is exactly determined
# by the collection of its elements. This allows to prove that there is exactly
# one empty set.


## >>>>>>>

  Axiom EXT. If for all z z \in x iff z \in y then x = y.

  ## Note that the axiom of extensionality is hardcoded in Naproche 2019. We
  ## state it here only to be able to reference to it.

  Definition. A subset of y is a set x such that every element of x is an
  element of y.
  Let x \subseteq y stand for x is a subset of y.
  Let x \subset y stand for x is a subset of y and x \neq y.

## <<<<<<<


Lemma 1. If x and y are empty then x = y.

# [...]


# 2.3 Pairing
# -----------

# The pairing axiom [...] postulates that for all sets x, y there is set z which
# may be denoted as z = {x,y}.

Definition. The unordered pair of x and y is {u | u = x \/ u = y}.
Let \{ x,y \} stand for the unordered pair of x and y.

Definition. The singleton set of x is {u | u = x}.
Let \{ x \} stand for the singleton set of x.

# By the axiom of extensionality, the term-like notation has the expected
# behaviour. E.g.:

Lemma 2. If a = {x,y} and b = {x,y} then a = b.

# 2.5 Ordered Pairs

# 2.11 Infinity
# -------------

# All the axioms so far can be realized in a domain of nite sets, [...]. The
# true power of set theory is set free by postulating the existence of one
# infinite set and continuing to assume the axioms. The axiom of infinity
# expresses that the set of "natural numbers" exists. To this end, some "number-
# theoretic" notions are defined.

Let 0 stand for \emptyset.

Definition 30. The successor of x is {u | u \in x \/ u = x}.
Let x + 1 stand for the successor of x.

# These notions are reasonable in the later formalization of the natural
# numbers. The axiom of infinity postulates the existence of a set which
# contains 0 and is closed under successors.


## >>>>>>>

  Definition. x is inductive iff 0 \in x and for all n \in x n + 1 \in x.

## <<<<<<<


Axiom INF. There is an inductive set.

# Intuitively this says that there is a set which contains all natural numbers.
# Let us dene set-theoretic analogues of the standard natural numbers:

Definition 31_a. 1 = 0 + 1.
Definition 31_b. 2 = 1 + 1.
Definition 31_c. 3 = 2 + 1.

# From the context it will be clear, whether "3", say, is meant to be the
# standard number "three" or the set theoretical object
#
# 3 = 2 \cup 3
#   = (1 + 1) \cup {1 + 1}
#   = ({\emptyset} \cup {{\emptyset}}) \cup {{\emptyset} \cup {{\emptyset}}}
#   = {\emptyset, {\emptyset}, {\emptyset} \cup {{\emptyset}}}.
#
# The set-theoretic axioms will ensure that this interpretation of "three" has
# the important number-theoretic properties of "three".


# 2.12 Foundation
# ---------------

# The axiom schema of foundation provides structural information about the set
# theoretic universe V. [...]

Axiom FOUND. Assume x is nonempty. There exists y \in x such that there is no
element of y \cap x.

# Viewing \in as some kind of order relation this means that every non-empty
# class has an \in-minimal element x \in A such that the \in-predecessors of x
# are not in A.

  Lemma prop_01. id--{x} is an injective function from x to x.
  Proof.
    id--{x} is a function from x to x.
    Let us show that for all u,v \in x if u \neq v then id--{x}[u] \neq
    id--{x}[v].
      Let u,v \in x.
      Assume u \neq v.
      id--{x}[u] = u and id--{x}[v] = v.
    end.
  qed.

  Lemma prop_02. id--{x} is a bijective function from x to x.
  Proof.
    id--{x} is an injective function from x to x (by prop_01).

    Let us show that Range(id--{x}) = x.
      For all u \in x id--{x}[u] = u.
      Thus for all u \in x u \in Range(id--{x}).
      For all u \in Range(id--{x}) id--{x}[u] = u.
      Thus for all u \in Range(id--{x}) u \in x.
    end.

    Hence id--{x} is a surjective function from x to x.
  qed.

  Lemma prop_03. If f is a function from x to y and g is a function from y to z
  then g \circ f is a function from x to z.
  Proof.
    Assume that f is a function from x to y and g is a function from y to z.

    Let us show that for all u \in x (g \circ f)[u] \in z.
      Let u \in x.
      f[u] \in y.
      g[f[u]] \in z.
    end.

    For all v \in Range(g \circ f) v = (g \circ f)[u] for some u \in x.
    Indeed Dom(g \circ f) = x.
    Thus for all v \in Range(g \circ f) v \in z.
    Hence Range(g \circ f) is a subset of z.
  qed.

  Lemma prop_04. If f is an injective function from x to y and g is an injective
  function from y to z then g \circ f is an injective function from x to z.
  Proof.
    Assume that f is an injective function from x to y and g is an injective
    function from y to z.
    g \circ f is a function from x to z (by prop_03).

    Let us show that for all u,v \in x if u \neq v then (g \circ f)[u] \neq
    (g \circ f)[v].
      Let u,v \in x.
      Assume u \neq v.
      f[u] \neq f[v].
      Indeed f is an injective function from x to y.
      f[u],f[v] \in y.
      Thus g[f[u]] \neq g[f[v]].
      Indeed g is an injective function from y to z.
    end.
  qed.

  Lemma prop_05. If f is a bijective function from x to y and g is a bijective
  function from y to z then g \circ f is a bijective function from x to z.
  Proof.
    Assume that f is a bijective function from x to y and g is a bijective
    function from y to z.
    g \circ f is an injective function from x to z (by prop_04).
    Let us show that for all w \in z  w \in Range(g \circ f).
      Let w \in z. Take v \in y such that g[v] = w.
      Indeed g is a surjective function from y to z.
      Take u \in x such that f[u] = v.
      Indeed f is a surjective function from x to y.
      (g \circ f)[u] = w.
    end.

    Thus z \subseteq Range(g \circ f).
    Therefore Range(g \circ f) = z (by EXT).
    Hence g \circ f is a surjective function from x to z.
  qed.

  Lemma prop_06. If f is an injective function from x to y and g is a bijective
  function from y to z then g \circ f is an injective function from x to z
  (by prop_04).
  Indeed If g is a bijective function from y to z then g is an injective
  function from y to z.

  Lemma prop_07. If f is a bijective function from x to y and g is an injective
  function from y to z then g \circ f is an injective function from x to z (by
  prop_04).
  Indeed If f is a bijective function from x to y then f is an injective
  function from x to y.

  Lemma prop_08. If f is a bijective function from x to y then f^{-1} is a
  bijective function from y to x.
  Proof.
    Assume that f is a bijective function from x to y.
    Range(f) = y.
    Indeed f is a surjective function from x to y.
    Thus Dom(f^{-1}) = y.
    Dom(f) = x.
    Thus Range(f^{-1}) = x.
    x is a subset of x.
    Hence f^{-1} is a function from y to x.

    For all u,v \in y if u \neq v then f^{-1}[u] \neq f^{-1}[v].
    proof.
      Let u,v \in y.
      Assume that u \neq v.
      Take a,b \in x such that f[a] = u and f[b] = v.
      Indeed Range(f) = y.
      a \neq b.
      Indeed f is an injective function from x to y.
      f^{-1}[u] = f^{-1}[f[a]] = a and f^{-1}[v] = f^{-1}[f[b]] = b.
    end.

    Hence f^{-1} is an injective function from y to x.
    Indeed f^{-1} is a function from y to x.

    For all u \in x u \in Range(f^{-1}).
    proof.
      Let u \in x.
      Take v \in y such that f[u] = v.
      f^{-1}[v] = f^{-1}[f[u]] = u.
    end.

    Thus x \subseteq Range(f^{-1}).
    Hence Range(f^{-1}) = x (by EXT).
    Therefore f^{-1} is a surjective function from y to x.

  Lemma prop_09. Let f be a function such that Dom(f) = x. f^[x] = Range(f).
  Proof.
    For all v \in f^[x] v \in Range(f).
    Indeed for all v \in f^[x] there is u \in x such that f[u] = v.
    Thus f^[x] is a subset of Range(f).
    For all v \in Range(f) v \in f^[x].
    Indeed for all v \in Range(f) there is u \in x such that f[u] = v.
    Thus Range(f) is a subset of f^[x].
    Hence the thesis (by EXT).

  Lemma prop_10. Let f be an injective function from x to y. Then f is a
  bijective function from x to f^[x].
  Proof.
    f^[x] is a subset of Range(f).
    Indeed f^[x] = Range(f) (by prop_09).
    Thus f is a function from x to f^[x].
    For all u,v \in x if u \neq v then f[u] \neq f[v].
    Indeed f is an injective function from x to y.
    Thus f is an injective function from x to f^[x].
    Indeed f is a function from x to f^[x].
    f is a surjective function from x to f^[x].
    Indeed f^[x] = Range(f) (by prop_09).
  qed.

  Lemma prop_11. Let f be an injective function from x to y. Dom(f^{-1})
  \subseteq y.
  Indeed Dom(f^{-1}) = Range(f).

  Lemma prop_12. Let f be a bijective function from x to y and g be an injective
  function from y to z. Then g \circ f is a bijective function from x to g^[y].
  Proof.
    g is a bijective function from y to g^[y] (by prop_10).
    Indeed g is an injective function from y to z.
    Hence the thesis (by prop_05).
  qed.

  Lemma prop_13. Let f be a function from x to y. Let z be a subset of x. Then
  the restriction of f to z is a function from z to y.
  Proof.
    Dom(f \upharpoonright z) = z.

    Let us show that for all u \in z (f \upharpoonright z)[u] \in y.
      Let u \in z.
      (f \upharpoonright z)[u] = f[u].
      Thus (f \upharpoonright z)[u] \in Range(f).
      If (f \upharpoonright z)[u] \in Range(f) then (f \upharpoonright z)[u] \in
      y.
      Indeed Range(f) is a subset of y.
    end.

    Thus for all v \in Range(f \upharpoonright z) v \in y.
    Hence (f \upharpoonright z)^[z] is a subset of y.
  qed.

  Lemma prop_14. Let f be a bijective function from x to y. Let z be a subset of
  x. Then the restriction of f to z is a bijective function from z to f^[z].
  Proof.
    f \upharpoonright z is a function from z to y (by prop_13).
    Indeed f is a function from x to y.

    Let us show that for all u,v \in z if u \neq v then
    (f \upharpoonright z)[u] \neq (f \upharpoonright z)[v].
      Let u,v \in z.
      Assume u \neq v.
      f[u] \neq f[v].
      Indeed f is an injective function from x to y.
      (f \upharpoonright z)[u] = f[u] and (f \upharpoonright z)[v] = f[v].
    end.

    (1) Thus f \upharpoonright z is an injective function from z to y.
    Indeed f \upharpoonright z is a function from z to y.

    f^[z] = (f \upharpoonright z)^[z].
    proof.
      For all u \in f^[z] u \in (f \upharpoonright z)^[z].
      Indeed for all u \in f^[z] there is v \in z such that u = f[v] =
      (f \upharpoonright z)[v].
      Thus f^[z] is a subset of (f\upharpoonright z)^[z].
      For all u \in (f \upharpoonright z)^[z] u \in f^[z].
      Indeed for all u \in (f \upharpoonright z)^[z] there is v \in z such that
      u = (f \upharpoonright z)[v] = f[v].
      Thus (f \upharpoonright z)^[z] is a subset of f^[z].
      Hence the thesis (by EXT).

    Therefore the thesis (by prop_10).

  Indeed for all u \in x \setminus y u \in x.

  Lemma prop_17. If x is nonempty then 0--{x} is a surjective function from x to
  1.
  Proof.
    Assume that x is nonempty.

      Let u \in x.
      0--{x}[u] = 0.
      0 \in 1.
    end.

    Hence Range(0--{x}) \subseteq 1. Thus 0--{x} is a function from x to 1.

    Let us show that for all u \in 1 u \in Range(0--{x}).
      Let u \in 1.
      For all v \in x 0--{x}[v] = 0.
      Take v \in x such that 0--{x}[v] = u.

# 3 Ordinal Numbers
# =================

# We had dened some natural numbers in set theory. Recall that
#
# 0 = \emptyset
# 1 = 0 + 1 = 0 \cup {0} = {0}
# 2 = 1 + 1 = 1 \cup {1} = {0,1}
# 3 = 2 + 1 = 2 \cup {2} = {0,1,2}
# ...
#
# We would then like to have N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. To obtain a set theoretic
# formalization of numbers we note some properties of the informal presentation:
#
# 1. Numbers are ordered by the \in-relation:
#    m < n iff m \in n.
#    E.g., 1 \in 3 but not 3 \in 1.
#
# 2. On each "number", the \in-relation is a strict linear order: 3 = {0, 1, 2}
#    is strictly linearly ordered by \in.
#
# 3. "Numbers" are "complete" with respect to smaller "numbers":
#    i < j < m  =>  i \in m.
#    This can be written with the \in-relation as
#    i \in j \in m  =>  i \in m.

Theorem 79_Cantor_Bernstein. If x \preccurlyeq y and y \preccurlyeq x then
x \sim y.
Proof.
  Assume x \preccurlyeq y and y \preccurlyeq x.
  Take an injective function f from x to y.
  Take an injective function g from y to x.
  y \setminus f^[u] \subseteq y for any u \in Pow(x).
  Define h[u] = x \setminus g^[y \setminus f^[u]] for u in Pow(x).

  For all u,v \in Pow(x) if u \subseteq v then h[u] \subseteq h[v].
  proof.
    Let u,v \in Pow(x).
    Assume u \subseteq v.
    f^[u] \subseteq f^[v].
    Then y \setminus f^[v] \subseteq y \setminus f^[u].
    Hence g^[y \setminus f^[v]] \subseteq g^[y \setminus f^[u]].
    Thus x \setminus g^[y \setminus f^[u]] \subseteq
    x \setminus g^[y \setminus f^[v]].
    Therefore h[u] \subseteq h[v].
  end.

  (1) For all u,v \subseteq x if u \subseteq v then h[u] \subseteq h[v].
  (2) h is a function from Pow(x) to Pow(x).

  There is w \subseteq x such that h[w] = w.

  Take w \subseteq x such that h[w] = w.

  (3) w = h[w] iff x \setminus w = g^[y \setminus f^[w]].

  Define F[u] = f[u] for u in w.
  g^{-1} is a bijective function from Range(g) to y.
  x \setminus w = g^[y \setminus f^[w]] \subseteq Range(g) (by 3).
  Define G[u] = g^{-1}[u] for u in x \setminus w.
  F is a bijective function from w to Range(F).
  G is a bijective function from x \setminus w to Range(G).

  Define H[u] =
    case u \in w -> F[u],
    case u \in x \setminus w -> G[u]
  for u in x.

  Let us show that for all u \in Range(H) u \in y.
    Let u \in Range(H).
    Take v \in x such that H[v] = u.
    If v \in w then u = H[v] = F[v] = f[v] \in y.
    If v \notin w then u = H[v] = G[v] = g^{-1}[v] \in y.
  end.

  Hence H is a function from x to y.

  Let us show that for all u,v \in x if u \neq v then H[u] \neq H[v].
    Let u,v \in x. Assume u \neq v.

    Case u,v \in w.
      H[u] = F[u] and H[v] = F[v].

    Case u,v \in x \setminus w.
      H[u] = G[u] and H[v] = G[v].
    end.

    Case u \in w and v \in x \setminus w.
      H[u] = F[u] and H[v] = G[v].
      v \in g^[y \setminus f^[w]] (by 3).
      We have G[v] \in y \setminus F^[w].
      Hence G[v] \neq F[u].
    end.

    Case u \in x \setminus w and v \in w.
      H[u] = G[u] and H[v] = F[v].
      u \in g^[y \setminus f^[w]] (by 3).
      We have G[u] \in y \setminus f^[w].
      Hence G[u] \neq F[v].
    end.
  end.

  Therefore H is an injective function from x to y.

  Let us show that for all v \in y: v \in Range(H).
    Let v \in y.

    Case v \in f^[w].
      There is u \in w such that f[u] = v.
      Thus there is u \in w such that F[u] = v.
    end.

    Case v \notin f^[w].
      v \in y \setminus f^[w].
      g[v] \in g^[y \setminus f^[w]].
      Then g[v] \in x \setminus h[w].
      We have g[v] \in x \setminus w.
      Thus  there is u \in x \setminus w such that G[u] = v.

  H is a surjective function from x to y.

Theorem 83_a. For all natural numbers n card(n) = n.
Proof by induction.
  Let n be a natural number.

  Case n = 0. Obvious.

  Case n \neq 0.
    We have n - 1 -<- n.
    Hence card(n - 1) = n - 1.
    card(n) \leq n.

    Let us show by contradiction that we have not card(n) < n.
      Assume card(n) < n.
      Take m = card(n).
      Take a bijective function f from m to n.
      Take u \in m such that f[u] = n - 1.

      Case u = m - 1.
        The restriction of f to m - 1 is a bijective function from m - 1 to
        n - 1.
        proof.
          f \upharpoonright m - 1 is a bijective function from m - 1 to
          f^[m - 1] (by prop_14).
          f^[m - 1] \subseteq n - 1.
          n - 1 \subseteq f^[m - 1].
          Thus f^[m - 1] = n - 1.
        end.

        Hence card(n - 1) \leq m - 1 < n - 1.
        Contradiction.
      end.

      Case u < m - 1.
        Define g[i] =
          case i \neq u -> f[i],
          case i = u -> f[m - 1]
        for i in m - 1.

        Let us show that for all x \in Range(g) x \in n - 1.
          Let x \in Range(g).

          Case x = g[u].
            Then x = f[m - 1] \neq f[u] = n - 1.
            Thus x \in n - 1.
          end.

          Case x \neq g[u].

            Then x \in n - 1.

        Thus g is a function from m - 1 to n - 1.

        Let us show that for all x \in n - 1 x \in Range(g).
          Let x \in n - 1.
          Then x \in Range(f) and x \neq n - 1 = f[u].

# We have the following closure properties for finite sets:

Lemma 87_a. Let x be finite. Then every subset of x is finite.
Proof.
  Let y \subseteq x.
  card(y) \leq card(x) (by subset_impl_leq).
  Hence y is finite.

Lemma 87_b_i. Let x be finite. Then x + 1 is finite.
Proof.
  Take n such that card(x) = n.
  Take a bijective function f from x to n.

  Define g[u] =
    case u \in x -> f[u],
    case u = x -> n
  for u in x + 1.

  g is a bijective function from x + 1 to n + 1.
  proof.
    g is a function from x + 1 to n + 1.
    Range(g) = n + 1.
    Thus g is a surjective function from x + 1 to n + 1.

    g is an injective function from x + 1 to n + 1.
    proof.
      Let us show that for all u,v \in x + 1 (if u \neq v then g[u] \neq g[v]).
        Let u,v \in x + 1.
        Assume u \neq v.

          g[u] = f[u] \neq f[v] = g[v].

Theorem 87_b_ii. Let x be finite. Assume that card(y) = 1. Then x \cup y is finite.
Proof.
  There is z such that y = {z}.
  proof.
    Take a bijective function f from 1 to y.
    For all z z \in Range(f) iff z = f[0].
    Range(f) = y.
  end.
  Take z such that y = {z}.

  Case z \in x.
    x \cup y = x.
    Hence card(x \cup y) = card(x) < omega.
  end.

  Case z \notin x.
    Define f[u] =
      case u = z -> x,
      case u \neq z -> u
    for u in x \cup y.

    f is a bijective function from x \cup y to x + 1.
    proof.
      f  is a function from x \cup y to x + 1.
      Range(f) = x + 1.
      Thus f is a surjective function from x \cup y to x + 1.

      f is an injective function from x \cup y to x + 1.
      proof.
        Let us show that for all i,j \in x \cup y (if i \neq j then
        f[i] \neq f[j]).
          Let i,j \in x \cup y.
          Assume i \neq j.

          Case i = z.
            Then f[i] = x \notin x (by prop_15).
            f[j] = j \in x.
          end.

          Case j = z.
            Then f[i] = i \neq x = f[j].
          end.

          Case i,j \neq z.
            Then f[i] = i \neq j = f[j].
          end.

  Lemma finite_minus_singleton_is_finite. Let card(x) = n \neq 0. Let
  y \subseteq x and card(y) = 1. Then card(x \setminus y) =
  n - 1.
  Proof.
    There is z such that y = {z}.
    proof.
      Take z \in y.

      Let us show by contradiction that there is no u \in y such that u \neq z.
        Assume there is u \in y such that u \neq z.

        Define g[v] =
          case v = z -> 0,
          case v \neq z -> 1
        for v in y.

        g is a surjective function from y to 2.
        Thus 2 \leq card(y) (by geq_iff_surj).
      end.
    end.

    Take z such that y = {z}.
    Take a bijective function h from x to n .

    Define f[u] =
      case h[u] = n - 1 -> h[z],
      case u = z -> n - 1,
      case u \neq z and h[u] \neq n -1 -> h[u]
    for u in x.

    f is a bijective function from x to n.
    proof.
      Let us show that for all v \in Range(f) v \in n.
        Let v \in Range(f).
        Take u \in x such that f[u] = v.

        Case h[u] = n - 1.
          v = f[u] = h[z] \in n.
        end.

        Case u = z.
          v = f[u] = n - 1 \in n.

        Case u \neq z and u \neq n - 1.
          v = f[u] = h[u] \in n.
        end.
      end.

      Thus Range(f) \subseteq n.

      Let us show that for all v \in n  v \in Range(f).
        Let v \in n. Take u \in x such that v = h[u].

        Case h[u] = n - 1.
          v = h[u] = n - 1 = f[z].
          Thus v \in Range(f).
        end.

        Case u = z.
          Take w \in x such that h[w] = n - 1.
          v = h[u] = f[w].
          Thus v \in Range(f).
        end.

        Case h[u] \neq n - 1 and u \neq z.
          v = h[u] = f[u] \in Range(f).
        end.
      end.

      Hence n \subseteq Range(f).
      Thus Range(f) = n (by EXT).
      Therefore f is a surjective function from x to n.

      f is a injective function from x to n.
      proof.
        Let us show that for all u,v \in x (if u \neq v then f[u] \neq f[v]).
          Let u,v \in x.
          Assume u \neq v.
        end.
      end.

    Range(f \upharpoonright (x \setminus y)) = n - 1.
    proof.
      Range(f \upharpoonright (x \setminus y)) \subseteq n - 1.
      Let us show that n - 1 \subseteq Range(f \upharpoonright (x \setminus y)).
        Let us show that for all v \in n - 1
        v \in Range(f \upharpoonright (x \setminus y)).
          Let v \in n - 1.
          Take u \in x such that f[u] = v.
          v \neq n - 1.
          u \neq z.
          u \in
          Dom(f \upharpoonright (x \setminus y)).
          Hence v = f[u] = (f \upharpoonright (x \setminus y))[u] \in
          Range(f \upharpoonright (x \setminus y)).
        end.
      end.
      Hence the thesis (by EXT).

    (3) x is a set and n is a set.
    (4) x \setminus y is a subset of x (by prop_prop_).

    f \upharpoonright (x \setminus y) is a bijective function from x \setminus y
    to n - 1 (by prop_14, 1, 2, 3, 4).

Theorem 87_b_iii. Let x,y be finite. Then x \cup y is finite.
Proof.
  Let us show by induction on n that for all n (for all a (if card(a) = n then

    Let n be a natural number.
    Let a be a set.
    Assume card(a) = n.

    Case n = 0.
      a = \emptyset. Hence x \cup a = x.

      (1) Take a bijective function g from a to n.
      Take z \in a such that g[z] = n - 1.
      (2) Take a set w such that w = {z}.

      card(w) = 1.
      Indeed 0--{w} is a bijective function from w to 1.
      card(a \setminus w) = n - 1 (by finite_minus_singleton_is_finite).
      We have card(a \setminus w) -<- card(a).

      (x \cup (a \setminus w)) \cup w is finite (by 87_b).
      x \cup a = (x \cup (a \setminus w)) \cup w.

Theorem 87_b_iv. Let x,y be finite. Then x \cap y is finite.

Theorem 87_b_v. Let x,y be finite. Then x \times y is finite.
Proof.
  Let us show by induction on n that for all n (for all a (if card(a) = n then

    Let n be a natural number.
    Let a be a set.
    Assume card(a) = n.

      Indeed 0--{w} is a bijective function from w to 1.
      card(a \setminus w) = n - 1 (by finite_minus_singleton_is_finite).
      We have card(a \setminus w) -<- card(a).

      (1) Hence x \times (a \setminus w) is finite.

      (2) x \times w is finite.
      proof.
        Take a bijective function f from x to card(x).
        Define h[u] = choose v \in x such that u = (v,z) in v for u in

              u = h[(u,v)].

            Hence the thesis (by EXT).

          Thus h is a surjective function from x \times w to x.
          h is an injective function from x \times w to x.

      We have x \times a = (x \times (a \setminus w)) \cup (x \times w).

Theorem 87_b_vi. Let x,y be finite. Then x \setminus y is finite.

Theorem 87_b_vii. Let x be finite. Then the powerset of x is finite.
Proof.
  Let us show by induction on n that for all n (for all a (if card(a) = n then
  the powerset of a is finite)).
    Let n be a natural number.
    Let a be a set.
    Assume card(a) = n.

    Case n = 0.
      a = \emptyset. Pow(a) = {\emptyset}.
    end.

    Case n \neq 0.
      (1) Take a bijective function g from a to n.

      Take z \in a such that g[z] = n - 1.
      Take a set w such that w = {z}.

      card(w) = 1.
      Indeed 0--{w} is a bijective function from w to 1.
      card(a \setminus w) = n - 1 (by finite_minus_singleton_is_finite).
      We have card(a \setminus w) -<- card(a).
      Hence the powerset of (a \setminus w) is finite.
      Take m such that m = card(Pow(a \setminus w)).
      Take a bijective function f from Pow(a \setminus w) to m.
      u \setminus w \in Pow(a \setminus w) for any u \in Pow(a).

      For all u \in Pow(a) (if z \notin u then u \in Dom(f)).
      proof.
        Let u \in Pow(a).
        Assume z \notin u. u = u \setminus w.
      end.

      Define h[u] =
        case z \notin u -> (f[u],0),
        case z \in u -> (f[u \setminus w],1)
      for u in Pow(a).

      h is a injective function from Pow(a) to m \times 2.
      proof.
        Let us show that Range(h) \subseteq m \times 2.
          Let us show that for all v \in Range(h) v \in m \times 2.
            Let v \in Range(h).
            Take u \in Dom(h) such that h[u] = v.

            Case z \notin u.
              v = h[u] = (f[u],0).
              f[u] \in Range(f) = m.
              0 \in 2.
              Hence v \in m \times 2.
            end.

            Case z \in u.
              v = h[u] = (f[u \setminus w],1).
              f[u \setminus w] \in Range(f) = m.
              1 \in 2. Hence v \in m \times 2.
            end.
          end.
        end.

        Thus h is a function from Pow(a) to m \times 2.

        Let us show that for all u,v \in Pow(a) (if u \neq v then
        h[u] \neq h[v]).
          Let u,v \in Pow(a).
          Assume u \neq v.

          Case z \notin u and z \notin v.
						u,v \in Pow(a \setminus w).
            f[u] \neq f[v].
            Indeed f is an injective function from Pow(a \setminus w) to m.
            Thus (f[u],0) \neq (f[v],0).
            Hence h[u] = (f[u],0) \neq (f[v],0) = h[v].
          end.

          Case z \in u and z \in v.
            u \setminus w \neq v \setminus w.
            proof by contradiction.
              Assume u \setminus w = v \setminus w.
              Then (u \setminus w) \cup w = (v \setminus w) \cup w.
              (u \setminus w) \cup w = u.
              (v \setminus w) \cup w = v.
              Thus u = v.
              Contradiction.
            end.

            [timelimit 10]
            Therefore f[u \setminus w] \neq f[v \setminus w].
            Indeed f is an injective function from Pow(a \setminus w) to m and
            u \setminus w, v \setminus w \in Pow(a \setminus w).
            Thus (f[u \setminus w],1) \neq (f[v \setminus w],1).
            Hence h[u] = (f[u \setminus w],1) \neq (f[v \setminus w],1) = h[v].
          end.

          Case z \notin u and z \in v.
            h[u] = (f[u],0) \neq (f[v \setminus w],1) = h[v].
          end.

          Case z \in u and z \notin v.
            h[u] = (f[u \setminus w],1) \neq (f[v],0) = h[v].
          end.
        end.
      end.

      (6) m is finite.
      (7) 2 is finite.

      m \times 2 is finite (by 87_b_v, 6, 7).
      Pow(a) \preccurlyeq m \times 2.
      Thus card(Pow(a)) \leq card(m \times 2) (by 81_a).
      Hence card(Pow(a)) < omega.

Theorem 88_a. Let x be finite. For all f (f: x \hookrightarrow x =>
f: x \twoheadrightarrow x).
Proof.
  Let us show by induction on n that for all n (for all a for all b (if card(a) =

  f: a \twoheadrightarrow b))).
    Let n be a natural number.
    Let a be an set.
    Let b be an set.
    Assume card(a) = n.
    Assume card(b) = n.

    Case n = 0.
      Take f such that f: a \hookrightarrow b.
      Dom(f) = a.
      Range(f) \subseteq b.
      b = \emptyset.
      Range(f) = \emptyset.
      Range(f) = b.
      f: a \twoheadrightarrow b.
    end.

    Case n \neq 0.
      Take c \in a.
      Let f: a \hookrightarrow b.
      Take y such that y = {c}.

      card(y) = 1.
      Indeed 0--{y} is a bijective function from y to 1.
      Take z such that z = {f[c]}.
      card(z) = 1.
      Indeed 0--{z} is a bijective function from z to 1.

      f \upharpoonright (a \setminus y) is an injective function from
      a \setminus y to b.
      There is no d \in a \setminus y such that
      (f \upharpoonright (a \setminus y))[d] = f[c].

      f \upharpoonright (a \setminus y) is an injective function from
      a \setminus y to b \setminus z.
      proof.
        Let us show that for all u \in a \setminus y
        (f \upharpoonright (a \setminus y))[u] \in b \setminus z.
          Let u \in a \setminus y.
          u \neq c.
          Thus f[u] \neq f[c].
          Hence f[u] \notin z.
        end.
        Thus f \upharpoonright (a \setminus y) is a function from a \setminus y
        to b \setminus z.

      card(a \setminus y) = n - 1 (by  finite_minus_singleton_is_finite).
      card(b \setminus z) = n - 1 (by  finite_minus_singleton_is_finite).
      We have card(a \setminus y) -<- card(a).

Theorem 116_Hausdorff. Let kappa \in Card. kappa^{+} is regular.
Proof.
  Assume the contrary.
  Take a cofinal subset x of kappa^{+} such that card(x) \neq kappa^{+}.
  card(x) < kappa^{+}.
  Then card(x) \leq kappa.
  Take a surjective function f from kappa to x (by geq_iff_surj).
  Indeed card(x),card(kappa) > 0 and card(x) \leq card(kappa).

  Define g[i] =
  	Case i has an element -> Choose a surjective function h from kappa to i in h,
  	Case i has no element -> 0--{kappa}
  for i in kappa^{+}.

  For any xi \in kappa g[f[xi]] is a function and Dom(g[f[xi]]) = kappa.
  proof.
    Let xi \in kappa.
    g[f[xi]] is a function.
    Indeed f[xi] \in kappa^{+}.

    Case f[xi] is nonempty.
      Dom(g[f[xi]]) = kappa.
    end.

    Case f[xi] is empty.
      Dom(g[f[xi]]) = kappa.
    end.
  end.

  [checktime 2][checkdepth 3]

  Define h[(xi,zeta)] = g[f[xi]][zeta] for (xi,zeta) in kappa \times kappa.

  [/checktime][/checkdepth]

  Let us show that h is a surjective function from kappa \times kappa to
  kappa^{+}.
  	Dom(h) = kappa \times kappa.

    Every element of kappa^{+} is an element of h^[kappa \times kappa].
  	proof.
  		Let n be an element of kappa^{+}.
      Take an element xi of kappa such that n < f[xi].
      Take an	element zeta of kappa such that g[f[xi]][zeta] = n.
      Then n = h[(xi,zeta)].
      Therefore the thesis.
      Indeed (xi,zeta) is an element of kappa \times kappa.
		end.

		Every element of h^[kappa \times kappa] is an element of kappa^{+}.
		proof.
			Let n be an element of h^[kappa \times kappa].
      We can take elements a,b of kappa such that n	= h[(a,b)].

			Case f[a]is nonempty.
			  h[(a,b)]=g[f[a]][b].
        Range(g[f[a]]) \in kappa^{+}.
        g[f[a]][b] \in kappa^{+}.
			end.

			Case f[a]is empty.
			  h[(a,b)]=g[f[a]][b].
        g[f[a]][b]=0.
        0 \in kappa^{+}.
			end.
		end.
	end.

  kappa^{+} \leq kappa.
	proof.
	  card(kappa \times kappa)=kappa.
    card(kappa^{+}),card(kappa \times kappa) > 0.
	  card(kappa^{+}) \leq card(kappa).
	end.

  Contradiction.

Definition. A sequence of cardinals on alpha is a function f such that Dom(f) =
alpha and f[x] is a cardinal for every element x of alpha.

Definition. Let kappa be a sequence of cardinals on alpha. SumSet(kappa,alpha) =
{(n,i) | i \in alpha and n \in kappa[i]}.

Definition 118. Let kappa be a sequence of cardinals on alpha. Sum(kappa,alpha) =
card(SumSet(kappa,alpha)).

Definition 118. Let kappa be a sequence of cardinals on alpha.

every element i of alpha)}.

Definition 118. Let kappa be a sequence of cardinals on alpha.

cardinal.

Lemma. Let kappa be a sequence of cardinals on alpha. Prod(kappa,alpha) is a
cardinal.

Lemma. Let lambda be a sequence  of cardinals on alpha. Assume that lambda[i]
has an element for every element i of alpha. ProdSet(lambda, alpha) has an
element.
Proof.
  Define f[i] = choose an element v of lambda[i] in v for i in alpha.
  Then f is an element of ProdSet(lambda,alpha).

Theorem 119_Koenig. Let kappa, lambda be sequences of cardinals on alpha.
Assume that for every element i of alpha kappa[i] < lambda[i]. Then
Sum(kappa,alpha) < Prod(lambda,alpha).
Proof.
  Assume the contrary.
  Sum(kappa,alpha) is an ordinal.
  Prod(lambda,alpha)is an ordinal.
  Prod(lambda,alpha) < Sum(kappa,alpha) or Sum(kappa,alpha) < Prod(lambda,alpha)
  or Sum(kappa,alpha) = Prod(lambda,alpha).
  Thus Prod(lambda,alpha) \leq Sum(kappa,alpha).

  Take a function G from SumSet(kappa,alpha) to ProdSet(lambda,alpha).
  proof.
    ProdSet(lambda, alpha) has an element (by 8303).
    Take x \in ProdSet(lambda, alpha).
    Define G[i] = x for i in SumSet(kappa,alpha).
  end.

  Define Diag[i] = {G[(n,i)][i] | n is an element of kappa[i]} for i in alpha.

  For every element i of alpha card(Diag[i]) < lambda[i].
  proof.
    Let i \in alpha.
    Define F[n] = G[(n,i)][i] for n in kappa[i].
    F^[kappa[i]] \subseteq Diag[i].
    Diag[i] \subseteq F^[kappa[i]].
    Thus F^[kappa[i]] = Diag[i] (by EXT).
    card(F^[kappa[i]]) \leq card(kappa[i]) (by im_leq_dom).
    Hence card(Diag[i]) = card(F^[kappa[i]]) \leq card(kappa[i]) = kappa[i] <
    lambda[i].
  end.

  Define f[i] = choose an element v of (lambda[i] \setminus Diag[i]) in v for i
  in alpha.
  Then f is an element of ProdSet(lambda,alpha).
  Take an element j of alpha and an element m of kappa[j] such that G[(m,j)] =
  f.
  Indeed f \in Range(G).
  G[(m,j)][j] is an element of Diag[j] and f[j] is not an element of Diag[j].
  Contradiction.
