Let X satisfies A and B stand for X satisfies A and X satisfies B.

Let X satisfies A and B and C stand for X satisfies A and X satisfies B and C.

Let X satisfies A and B and C and D stand for X satisfies A and X satisfies B and C and D.

Let X satisfies A and B and C and D and E stand for X satisfies A and X satisfies B and C and D and
E.

Let X satisfies A and B and C and D and E and F stand for X satisfies A and X satisfies B and C and
D and E and F.

Let X satisfies A and B and C and D and E and F and G stand for X satisfies A and X satisfies B and
