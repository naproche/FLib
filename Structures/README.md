This is an approach on formalizing a general theory about mathematical
structures. It was developed in the context of a bachelor thesis in 2020 and
depends on a special fork of Naproche which is no longer maintained.
Unfortunately the changes made in this fork are not adopted to the current
version of Naproche, hence the latter will not accept this formalization.
Fortunately, it looks like the latest advances in the development of Naproche
will make it possible to adopt this formalization to an official version of
Naproche in the not too long future.
