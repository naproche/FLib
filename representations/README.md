# Representation Theory in ForTheL
These are formalizations of some topics from representation theory of algebras to be checked by Naproche-SAD.

The linear algebra formalizations are a rewrite of the ones found [here](../linear_algebra_ftl).

To run the formalizations in Naproche-SAD, create a folder "representations" inside the "examples" folder and paste the FTL files there.
